# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    For team meetings, our team plans to hold meetings at least once a week in-person and hold additional meetings virtually. Each meeting will last at least an hour depending on how much progress we need to make. For our virtual meetings, we plan to hold them via FaceTime or Discord and will follow the same strucutre that we develop for our in-person meetings. During our meetings, we will assign one person each time to update the development log with progress from the meeting. 

2. **Assistance** 

    If assistance is needed, teammates will contact each other through the iMessage group chat that we created. If a teammate requests assistance on a particular task, other teammates are expected to respond in the groupchat as soon as possible.

3. **Respect** 

    We will ensure a healthy work environment within our group by understanding that we are all working towards the same end goal. During our meetings, we will make sure that all team members are involved and have something to work on so that everyone feels like they are contributing.
    
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    
    We will assign the workload for this project by having each teammate take lead of each one of the 4 delivarebles. Each one of us will lead the completion of the functional code-base, descriptive README, written report, and final presentation. Although each one of us will take lead of our respective part, when someone faces an unforseen amount of work or complications, others will assist and pitch in. For example, someonne that is ahead on the final presentation would also assist in completing the longer functioning code-base deliverable. We will also cater the delivarables to each person based on their strengths and weaknesses. For example, omeone that is stronger in programing would work on the functioning code-base whereas someone that is good at writing and organization would create the final presentation.
    

5. **Time Commitment** 

    I believe each group member will need to spend 5-6 hours outside of class time in a week to complete the project. Some members in the group are also part of other clubs and organizations but we have all agreed to prioritze working on this final project. In order to account for prior commitments like dance practices or club meetings, we have created a schedule locating 5-6 hours of overlapping free time and we will meet during those designated times. Additionally, once new conflicts occur, our group mates are flexible and willing to work at odd hours and curate a new schedule with new meeting times.
    
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    
    The team will resolve situations when there is a disagreement by having a civil discussion regarding the pros and cons of the opposing arguments. Additionally, each member will be held accountable to complete their respective tasks within a given time frame. If this is not achieved, the other members of the group must take responsibility to gently remind their teammate to complete their tasks. In the same manner, if one member is habitually late, the other members must take the responsibility to recognize the issue and alert the teammate to remain punctual so we can complete the project efficiently. Overall, as we are friends, we will be sure to resolve conflicts in an efficient and non-problematic manner.
